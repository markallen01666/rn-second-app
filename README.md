# rn-second-app

This is a simple React Native App built using Expo. It's my second React Native app put together following Max Swarzmuller's course "React Native - The Practical Guide" on Udemy.

The app is a simple 'todo' list builder, in this case focussed on learning goals while taking the React Native course
